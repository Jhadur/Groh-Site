		<p class="style7 style6 style3 style1"><h1>APPOINTMENTS</h1></p>
		<p class="style6 style7"><p class="style6 style7"><span class="style1"><em>When can I make an appointment? </em></span><br />
        Appointments may be made Monday through Friday between 8:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Appointments for surgery or other special procedures will be coordinated by our O.R. schedulers. 
        <em></p>
		
        <p class="style6 style7"><span class="style1">When should I arrive for my appointment?</span> </em><br />
        New patients need to arrive 15 minutes early to complete the necessary forms and should be prepared to complete a health history and proper insurance documentation. Patients should bring a list of their current medications and the name and phone number of an emergency contact.</p>
		
        <p class="style6 style7"><p class="style6 style7"><span class="style1"><em>What should I bring for my workers&rsquo; compensation appointment? </em></span><br />All workers&rsquo; compensation patients will also need to provide the appropriate authorization forms from their employer. Case managers will need to provide a card to be placed on the chart.</p>
		
        <p class="style6 style7"><p class="style6 style7"><span class="style1"><em>What if I need to cancel my appointment?</em></span><br />
        If it is necessary to cancel or change an appointment, please try to notify the office at least 48 hours in advance so that we may make the appointment time available to other patients.</p>
		
        <p class="style6 style7"><span class="style1"><em>What should I do if I have an emergency?</em></span><br />
        An orthopaedic surgeon from Blue Ridge Bone &amp; Joint is on call 24 hours a day. Should an emergency arise after office hours, we suggest you first contact our physician on call at (828) 258-8800.</p>
		
        <p class="style7 style6 style3 style1"><h1>MEDICATIONS</h1></p>
        
		<p class="style6 style7"><span class="style1"><em>What should I expect when I request a prescription or prescription refill? </em></span><br />
        We want to process requests for prescription refills as quickly as possible. When a prescription needs to be refilled, please call the pharmacist or notify our office. Calls received after 4:00 P.M. for routine refills will be handled the next business day. Please try to call before noon to insure a same-day response. We will need the patient's name and the pharmacy name and phone number. In addition, we will need the patient's address and date of birth in order to ensure proper medication control.</p>
        <p class="style6 style7"><span class="style1"><em>Can I get a prescription refill after hours? </em></span><br />
        During evenings, weekends, and holidays, the doctor on call does not have immediate access to the patient's records. Therefore, routine prescriptions cannot be refilled during this time. Please contact the office during weekdays and before any medication has completely run out.</p>
		
        <p class="style7 style6 style3 style1"><h1>FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS </h1></p>
        <p class="style6 style7"><span class="style1"><em>When is my payment due?</em></span> <br />
		We appreciate payment for all clinic services at the time they are rendered. These include: office visits, X-rays, and supplies. <br />
		<p class="style6 style7"><span class="style1"><em>What forms of payment do you accept? </em></span><br />
        Blue Ridge Bone &amp; Joint accepts cash, personal checks, Visa, and MasterCard. As a courtesy, we will file your medical insurance at no charge. In order to provide this service for you, we must have all of your insurance data along with a signed authorization.</p> 
		<p class="style6 style7"><span class="style1"><em>What if my insurance coverage changes? </em></span><br />Please notify us in writing of any changes in your insurance coverage. It is important to note that you are ultimately responsible for payment of your account.</p>
        <p class="style6 style7"><span class="style1"><em>Should I keep my payment receipts? </em></span><br />
        Please keep copies of all billing information so that you can follow up on claims with your insurance company if it becomes necessary.</p>
        <p class="style7 style6 style3 style1"><h1>DISABILITY FORMS </h1></p>
        <p class="style6 style7"><span class="style1"><em>What do I need to know about disability forms?</em></span><br />
        Disability Claim Forms require specific information regarding the status of your disability. We routinely complete and mail disability forms for our patients. Disability forms other than medical, such as auto, loan, and mortgage payment insurance, will be prepared and mailed for a nominal fee. During your office visit, please leave any forms your employer or insurance company has given you at the front desk with our staff.</p>
